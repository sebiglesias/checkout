# 01-30-2022

General polish of the ui (visual bug-ish behaviour fixes, more related to CSS) and exception handling of api calls.

A happy path of the app can be seen in `docs/imgs/01-30-2022-general-video.mov`.

I was going to work on making both the ui and api a docker image, but I won't be having much time to work on today, 
so I'll only be updating the docs with instructions to run everything locally.  Same with tests, I would come up with a 
bash script to run everything, but I would require a some time to properly try it out and test it.

I had fun making this small project, I hope you like it and that we can discuss further improvements or use cases.
Have a nice day!
