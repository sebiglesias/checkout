I'm starting with the express api first. I will be using (prisma)[https://www.prisma.io/] as an ORM to create the tables in postgres
and avoid some time "wasted" over making in SQL. I've never used prisma, and their modeling language, as all modeling languages
is always a bit of a struggle with relations until you get used to it.

As a first instance, the cart will be something stored only in the browser. For the time being I'll assume there is only one client,
simulating as if this app was running on a specific tablet on a specific store. Just to get the _happy path_ working.

The `/menu` endpoint has no pagination, something to add later after a basic UI is finished.

I stumbled upon a fresh bug with prisma that's unresolved yet, https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/10141, yay. It is most
likely due to how I'm creating the orderHeader object. I will add a basic create-react-app scaffold and call it a day.

Posting to `/orders` worked, as well as reaching the `/menu`. Things to improve tomorrow or during the weekends: 

- Make the server calculate the amount to pay
- Add pagination to menu
