I'll be starting with the UI today. 


## Thinking the design

I think a general basic UI were I picture a Catalogue page, a Cart page, a Payment Page and an Order page. This is what 
I want each page to show me:

### Catalogue: 
 Will have a top bar with a search bar and a link to the cart. The user will be abe to navigate and see 
 categories & items, as well as add and remove items to and from the cart
 
### Cart
 Will show the items added and will allow the user to add and remove items from it, as well as to show a sum of the total price

### Payment

Will only show 1 available payment option, others disabled. For simplicity the only one enabled will be cash and will call a mocked
`/pay` endpoint.

### Order

Will show the final result of the order with all its details. I might make a list of orders to show all previous ones, but I'll see how 
I'm doing with time first.

## Implementation

I will start with the Catalogue page and base all my other components from there. I will need these components in it

- Top Bar: Component with a logo, a search bar and link to cart (I'll see if I can make something fancy on a later iteration if I have time, but for now a link will suffice)
- SearchBar: search bar with a local filtering and simple search of items/categories, it wil not go and look for items on the "backend" for simplicity
- Cart link: a Cart link button
- Item/Category card: it will show a category or item, with its info and the ability to add the items in to the cart with a certain quantity and modify it

4. Including option to add and remove items to cart

6. Order Result

As I was doing the steps for sending the order, I realized an order needs steps and therefore a certain variable to handle its state
through the several steps. So I'll be adding a variable and different steps for storing the order in the db.

The possible steps the order can have, at least in this humble and simple app, are:
- WAITING_FOR_PAYMENT
- PAYED

This could be use to later extend into more complicated or robust states, but basically represent 2 stores/updates on the same registry of an order in the db.

A *PAYED* order is considered *DONE*.

Also, probably more steps can be added for the user to be sure of the thing that he/she is going to purchase. But I guess for the scope I aimed for 
the ones that appear are enough.

A MUCH MUCH better option would have been to register each order event as an actual event in a queue and consume & manage the order itself from there, but it beats the scope of the app as well.
